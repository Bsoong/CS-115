"""
1-bit memory circuit stores, or latches on, to a "high" or "low" state, and "reads" new data from the input when enabled.

S-R Latch= a bistable multivibrator with two output states
            _
    Q=1     Q=0 is set
            _
    Q=0     Q=0 is reset 
If both Q and LineQ are the same, the state is invalid
Activation of s sets Circuit " " r restes "
Activation of both s and r is invalid
